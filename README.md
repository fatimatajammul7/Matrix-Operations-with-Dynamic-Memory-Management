# Matrix Operations with Dynamic Memory Management

This project demonstrates various matrix operations using dynamic memory allocation and deallocation in C++. The operations include matrix addition, matrix transpose, row interchange, and symmetry check. The matrices are read from an input file, processed, and the results are displayed.

## Features

- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Allocation and deallocation of matrices using pointers.
- **Matrix Addition**: Add two matrices of the same dimensions.
- **Matrix Transpose**: Compute the transpose of a matrix.
- **Row Interchange**: Swap two rows in a matrix.
- **Symmetry Check**: Check if a matrix is symmetric.

## Compilation Instructions

To compile and run the file, follow these instructions:

1. **Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed** (e.g., g++, clang++).

2. **Compile the code** using the following command:
   ```bash
   g++ -o program Matrix operations.cpp
3. **Run the executable with the following command:**
   ```bash
   ./program
